Horiseon is a social media marketing team ready to help your business grow. As a developer my job was to use the best html and css syntax for their application to improve the codebase for long-term sustainability. Working with the HTML index file I was able to increase efficiecny in reading the code as well as in the CSS style. These improvements, along with their comments, will allow future developers to more easily access and understand the layout of the webpage. 

The final deployed application can be accessed at https://omar-94.github.io/horiseon-homework/
